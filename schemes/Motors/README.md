# <div align="center"> Motor Selection</div> 
To compete in the World Robot Olympiad (WRO) in the Future Engineers category, we chose the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Medium Motor. Let's take a closer look at the design features and benefits of a mid-motor, and explain why it is the optimal choice for this competition.
###  Brief description of motors

<tr ><th colspan="3">NXT motor</th></tr>
<tr align="center">
<td><img src="./img/nxt.jpg" alt="NXT" align=center /></td>
<th>This motor is specific to the NXT set (2006). Includes a rotation encoder, returning to the NXT the position of the shaft with 1Â° resolution. Because of the special connector of this motor (non-standard phone plug type), a cable adapter is required to drive this motor with regular 9V sources. Not recommended for use with a RCX which can't deliver the high current that this motor can consume. Slow rotation speed, minimizing the need of external gear train.</th>

<th>This motor is very similar to NXT motor, but with slightly better fixing capability (compatible with Technic frames, holes aligned with hub). Its efficiency seems slightly lower.</th>

<tr ><th colspan="3">EV3 Medium motor</th></tr>
<tr align="center">
<td><img src="./img/ev3m.jpg" alt="ev3" align=center /></td>
<th>This motor is one of the highlights of EV3 set compared to NXT one: a motor of reduced size and classical front axle hub. Reduced size comes with reduced power, similar to PF medium motor (but being more down-geared, it is slower and delivers more torque).</th>

### Rear-Drive DC Motor
- When selecting a DC motor among commonly available options in the market, considering factors such as weight, rotational speed, and torque, we have identified the following four suitable DC motors.
- Among them, the three types of motors, JGA25, have different model numbers but share a similar physical appearance, and their differences are as follows.

- After conducting experimental research, we found that choosing the high-speed 1630rpm JGA-370 motor resulted in lower torque, making it difficult for the vehicle to move effectively. On the other hand, opting for the high-torque JGA-371 motor led to an excessively low rotational speed, which did not meet the requirements for the vehicle's operation.
- __Therefore, based on these findings, we ultimately selected the 620rpm JGA-370 motor as the rear-wheel drive DC motor for the vehicle. This choice strikes a balance between rotational speed and torque, providing the necessary performance for the vehicle's propulsion.__  

### Motor Drive Controller
- When testing the operation of the motor, simply providing power does not effectively control the movement of the GA25-370 motor, making it impossible to adjust the speed. Therefore, we need to install a motor controller to regulate the speed of the DC gear motor. Currently, there are two options available in the market: the L293D chip and the L298N module. To reduce weight, we __chose the smaller L293D chip.__   
- __Its compact size allows us to install more sensors, thereby saving space, reducing weight, and increasing the maneuverability of the vehicle.__
