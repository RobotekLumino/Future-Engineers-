- **Navigation buttons (up, down, left, right)**: To move through the menu.
- **Back button (Back)**: To exit the current menu or cancel an action.
- **On/Off Button**: Used to turn the EV3 Brick on and off.

## Programming the EV3 Brick

The EV3 Brick supports programming using various environments:

- **LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Software**: The official graphical programming environment from LEGO that uses blocks to create programs. It is an intuitive tool designed for children and beginners.
- **LEGO Mindstorms Education EV3 Classroom**: A platform designed for educational institutions with advanced features and integration with educational standards.

- **Clev3r for EV3**: The ability to program on the basis of basic plus for more experienced users, which opens up access to more complex algorithms and integration with other systems. Also, the code compilation is several times faster compared to other platforms. [Platform Performance Analysis](/research/comparison_of_performance_of_different_programming_platforms/README.md)
### There are also many other programming tools for this brick.
